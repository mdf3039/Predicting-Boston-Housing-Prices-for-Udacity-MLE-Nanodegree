    "Welcome to the first project of the Machine Learning Engineer Nanodegree! In this notebook, some template code has already been provided for you, and you will need to implement additional functionality to successfully complete this project. You will not need to modify the included code beyond what is requested. Sections that begin with **'Implementation'** in the header indicate that the following block of code will require additional functionality which you must provide. Instructions will be provided for each section and the specifics of the implementation are marked in the code block with a 'TODO' statement. Please be sure to read the instructions carefully!\n",

    "In addition to implementing code, there will be questions that you must answer which relate to the project and your implementation. Each section where you will answer a question is preceded by a **'Question X'** header. Carefully read each question and provide thorough answers in the following text boxes that begin with **'Answer:'**. Your project submission will be evaluated based on your answers to each of the questions and the implementation you provide.  \n",

    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preoprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MDEV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MDEV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MDEV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "Run the code cell below to load the Boston housing dataset, along with a few of the necessary Python libraries required for this project. You will know the dataset loaded successfully if the size of the dataset is reported."

    "**Answer: I believe that an increase in the average amount of rooms among homes in the neighborhood will cause an increase in the value of MDEV. More rooms among homes generally means more space for the residents within the homes. If you can afford more space, you get a home with more space. Therefore if a home has 8 rooms, it is most likely a mansion in a really nice neighborhood, as compared to a one room studio. Therefore, an average of more rooms would most likely lead to a higher MDEV. \n",
    "For LSTAT, the neighborhood which homeowners had the least amount of net worth would have a LSTAT of or close to 100. This means that all the homewoners in Boston have a greater net worth than the homewoners in that neighborhood. This would be the poorest neighborhood in Boston. On the other hand, if 0 Boston homeowners have a greater net worth than the homewoners in your neighborhood, then you live in the best neighborhood of Boston. The smaller the LSTAT, MDEV increases.\n",
    "Teachers make a decent salary. Therefore teachers would not live in the worst neighborhoods in Boston. Therefore, the better the neighborhood, the more likely teachers will live in it. Therefore, there will be an increase in MDEV with an increase in the ratio of students to teachers, assuming there are equal amounts of students in each neighborhood.**"

The consumer is looking for different ammeneties in a house today than almost 40 years ago. The features in the data are not sufficient to describe a home. Swimming pool, size of property, size of living space, number of bathrooms, and garage parking are just a few details that matter to any homebuyer. The model predictions seem to fluctuate; I have already detailed why they are needed. Data collected in an urban city would not be applicable to a rural city.
